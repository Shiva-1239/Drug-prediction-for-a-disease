In today's world, most people rely on allopathic treatments and medicines. This paper 
introduces an application programming interface (API) that recommends drugs to users based 
on their symptoms, diagnosed by analyzing these symptoms using machine learning
algorithms. We use a mining procedure to extract insightful information, helping identify the 
most precise disease related to the symptoms. Users can easily identify diseases by inputting 
their symptoms, and the application generates possible infections. This system is particularly 
helpful in critical situations where reaching a doctor is challenging or when professionals are 
not readily available. Predictive analysis is performed on the disease, leading to drug 
recommendations based on various features in the database. The experimental results can 
contribute to further research and the development of healthcare tools.# Drug-prediction-for-a-disease
